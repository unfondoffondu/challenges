Cracking code challenges is good practice.  Solving these types of problems forces you to read and
comprehend code that was intentionally made difficult to understand.  While competing in the NCL,
these were by my favorites to attempt.  

Writing code challenges is good practice.  I will periodically add challenges here and if anyone wants
to submit a flags to me by all means e-mail me!  One flag = 100 cool points.  If you have challenges, 
feel free to contribute!

Get crackin!
